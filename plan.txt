Plan for ottr:

Tasks:
- Define and prioritize desired features
- Identify initial tools

Language:
- Primarily Javascript

Desired Features:

- Dice rolling - This should be fairly simple to add. 
- Chat - It would be nice if an existing program like Discord could be tied
  in here. Otherwise it will need something basic eventually.
- Character Sheets - Need to be able to create and share character sheets.
  Should be able to roll from character sheets. Should be easy to mod in order
  to support many game types.
- NPC/Location/Item generation and tracking - Need to be able to create and
  track. Should support creating ahead of time and sharing later with players.
  In general, everything that gets created should have some sort of visiblity
  flag to allow the GM to hide it from players.
- Wiki - Ideally this would automatically tie in to the creation of NPCs, 
  locations, and items. Wiki.js looks like it might work well for this. 

Minimum Features
- Communication between clients and host
- Dice rolls
- Chat
- Character sheets
- Drawing
- Game log
